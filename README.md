# Angular Standalone APP
This is an attempt to create an Angular app without a NgModule. The standalone component is a new feature in Angular V14.

Moreover:
  - I also tested how can create a lazy load routers by just importing the component
  - Use the `ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER` hook that replaced APP_INITIALIZER
  - Use `Inject` that returns an instance of a given service

** I will add more Angular V14 features in the same repository ** Keeping in touch
